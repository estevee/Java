# MPG Array

Java Programming : Arrays and Functions

Create a project called MPG.

Make sure to document well.

Rufus, a junior computer programmer, is fanatical about his new GMC Pickup Truck and wants to keep track of the Miles, Gallons and MPG of his truck. To do this, he wants to write a simple program that will allow him to enter the Miles driven and Gallons of gas used each week and will calculate the MPG for each week as well as his Total Average MPG and display the results. Since the dog ate his homework, his car won’t start, he has to work and he is sick, he’s asked you to write the program for him.


1. Declare the arrays
2. Prompt and get the size of the arrays (how many weeks) and then create the arrays
3. Prompt and get the values for the Miles array.
4. Prompt and get the values for the Gallons array.
5. Calculate the values for the MPG Array.
6. Display the three arrays in this manner.

```
        Miles    Gallons    MPG
        ------   -------- ---------
Week 1  240.5   10.3        23.3
Week 2  300.0   15.6        19.2
Total   540.5   25.9        20.8
```
