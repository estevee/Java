# FormatLine

Java Exercise: Prompt the user to enter a line of text. Assume the line consists of one or more "words." Words are separated by one or more spaces. If the line length is less than 60 then print the line and exit the program. Otherwise, the line is split into multiple lines having line lengths that do not exceed 60 characters. The program does not insert newlines into the middle of words.
